/* Styling for Alchemy News Network, which overrides default bootstrap styling. 

Note: As a developer for IBM, I wouldn't actually use bootstrap for CSS. I would develop my own front-end component library to use as needed. This is just for quick development.

Using component frameworks is convenient but it loads web apps with a lot of unused code. It's best to only use the components that are actually needed.

What I'd like to do is use something like Polymer to build custom reuseable components, which greatly speed up development time.
